# __Stick Kick - Portfolio Project 2__
This is a website for Stick Kick, a penalty kick game where users compete against the computer in a game of chance alternating between kicking and saving with the first to 5 goals winning.

The aim of this project is to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the user's actions and altering the way the site displays information to achieve the user's goals.

## __UX & Design__
As the site is a single-serving site, there is only one page. I opted to keep the design of the page simple and clean so as it doesn't distract from the main game section of the page.

### __User Stories__
- As a user, I want to be able to see the site name clearly at the top of the page

- As a user, I want to be able to toggle the game's music on or off

- As a user, I want to be able to access instructions on how to play the game and easily exit the instructions without disrupting the game

- As a user, I want to be able to reset the game at any point

- As a user, I want to be able to clearly see the game and the current state (See if I'm kicking or saving and see if I scored a goal or saved a shot)

- As a user, I want to be able to see the current score of the game

- As a user, I want to be able to control the game using clearly labelled buttons

### __Wireframes__
Before writing any code, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for the page

### __Colour Scheme__
I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-fafafa-008037-03989e-737373-004aad-ff1616) to choose a colour scheme that would make the site content look simple and make the game images look like a soccer pitch with both the user and computer players easily distinguishable.

### __Typography__
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to select and import the Mali font for all site text.
